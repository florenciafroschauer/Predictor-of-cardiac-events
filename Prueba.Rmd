### Introduction

The Cardiology service of a university hospital sent us to carry out a system that facilitates the decision to admit / not admit a patient who enters the ward for possible cardiac problems. To do this, we were given a data set containing the data from 1000 patients with cardiac events admitted to the same hospital.

### Data Study

In the dataset we find 20 variables that represent the questions that a patient is asked when they enter the guard, to determine which ones are important we investigated the main risk factors for people with cardiac events and their causes.

```{r graph, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(plotrix)
library(ggridges)
library(ggplot2)
library(treemap)
library(dplyr)
library(babynames)
library(maps)
library(geosphere)
library(plotly)
library(gapminder)
library(gganimate)
library(readr)

dataset <- read_csv("C:/Users/I5/Downloads/dataset.csv")
colnames(dataset)[2] <- "Genero"
pacientsWithEvents = subset(dataset, Evento == 1)
patientsQ8 = subset(pacientsWithEvents, select = (Edad))
more65 <- round(sum(patientsQ8$Edad>65)/length(patientsQ8$Edad)*100)
less65 <- round(sum(patientsQ8$Edad<=50)/length(patientsQ8$Edad)*100)
pie3D(c(more65,less65),main = "Patients with events ageÂ´s", labels = c(paste(more65,"%"),paste(less65,"%")),col = c("lightgreen","#ffff99"),labelcex = 1, explode = 0.1, theta = 1, mar = c(5,5,5,5))
legend(.3,1,c("Age >65","Age <=65"),fill = c("lightgreen","#ffff99"))

```
